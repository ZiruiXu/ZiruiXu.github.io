    <h2>Grading Policy</h2>
    <p>Assuming the full credit for the recitation is 10 (otherwise your score will be scaled accordingly), then your score will be calculated by the following formula:</p>
    <p>score = max { 0, min { 10, 10 &ndash; max { 0, absence &ndash; 3 } + presenter &ndash; 10 plagiarism } },</p>
    <p>where "absence" is the number of recitations from which you are absent, "presenter" is the number of recitations at which you are the presenter, and "plagiarism" is the number of recitations for which you dishonestly submit attendance remotely. In other words, your score will always be between 0 and 10, and you can skip up to 3 recitations without any penalty. After skipping 3 recitations, you will lose 1 point each time you skip 1 more recitation. However, you can earn 1 point back each time you are the presenter of your group. Furthermore, if you never show up at a recitation but dishonestly submit attendance remotely, then that is considered as plagiarism, and you will lose 10 points each time you commit plagiarism.</p>
    <p>The bottom line is that you will receive full credit if you only skip 3 recitations, or even if you skip 4 recitations and be a presenter once.</p>
